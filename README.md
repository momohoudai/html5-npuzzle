# What is this?

This is mostly just a project for me to get familiarized with HTML5. 

It is a simple N-Puzzle demo, nothing more.
The N-Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missed.

The game is avalible to play at: https://momodevelop.gitlab.io/html5-npuzzle/

# How to use?

(disclaimer, this is just a project for my self-learning, so sorry if the instructions seemed vague.)
